### Input v1

## Title
Team Profile Generator

## Description
The app is a command-line interface to generate a webpage listing the members of a software engineering team. The team can use the page to gain quick access to information about team's mission and members including email address and GitHub profile. The team manager proceeds through a series of questions to describe each member including name, role/title, employee id along with role specific information such as office number for the manager, GithHub user name for the engineer(s) and current school for intern(s). The app will use this information to create a webpage.


## Installation
(1) Fork the repo, (2) Clone the forked repo locally, (3) Run "npm install" (to install dependencies), (4) Run "node index.js" (from the root directory). To run Jest tests, run "npm test". Jest is setup to use a "--watcher" and provide "--coverage" statistics.

## Use
This app creates a website which provides detailed information about a software engineering team from the command line.

## Features
This app includes features such as (a) a series of command line prompts to gather team member information, (b) validation for required information and email, default answers for image, modular breakdown of the code, use of inquirer to provide the questions including use of validation and filters (to format the answers). There code includes a robust set of Jest tests to make the code more maintainable.

## Enhancements
This app can be enhanced by (a) creating the ability to add multiple teams with functionality to switch between teams on the webpage, (b) ability to add a team name and mission, (c) provide more or custom detail about each team member such as the ability to upload a photo, add pronouns, add fun facts, add a phone number and more, (d) the ability to add or delete team members (which can now be done but it's a complete re-build rather than amending the current team), (e) the abiility to modify team member information on the website or from the command line, (f) the ability to customize the page with team colors, icons or other team specific/brand details and (f) more.
