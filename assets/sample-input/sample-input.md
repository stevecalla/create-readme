## Title
Create Readme

## Description
The app will create a professional README for a project. A user answers each question. If a question is not answered a header for that section will appear in the README. After completion of all prompts, the README will be available in the current directory and should be edited to include the final content. 

## Installation
(1) Fork the repo, (2) Clone the forked repo locally, (3) Run "npm install" (to install dependencies), (4) Run "node index.js" (from the /assets/js directory).

## Use
This app creates a readme file based on user input.

## Features
This app includes features such as validation for required information and email, default answers for image, video and contribution, license badge append, instructions at the start and end of the program, modified question prefix and suffix, modular breakdown of the code (into section such as questions, answers, write to file et al), use of inquirer filter to trim and additional sections in the readme template to allow the user to customize the readme.

## Enhancements
This app can be enhanced by adding more detail instructions, functionality to upload images and video files, allow users to select sections of the readme then build the readme dynamically using the fs append feature and more.
